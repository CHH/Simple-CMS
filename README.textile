h1. How to install

# Clone the git repository to your web root (e.g. htdocs folder) with git clone git://github.com/yuri41/Simple-CMS.git
# Clone the Spark Web Framework with git clone git://github.com/yuri41/Spark-Web-Framework in the same folder as you cloned the CMS code
# Make sure you have the Zend Framework either installed over PEAR or somewhere in your PHP include path
# Setup a new Apache virtual host and point the document root to the folder your CMS instance lives in (e.g. htdocs/Simple-CMS). Don't forget to update your /etc/hosts or C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file if you don't own a domain.

h1. Usage

h2. Pages

To create a page, simply put a file with the extension ".txt" into the "pages" folder.
If the Root of the Domain (e.g. http://example.com/) gets requested, the page named
"index.txt" gets rendered. 

If you want subpages in the style of "http://example.com/foo/bar" just create
a folder "foo" in the "pages" directory. Then create the file "bar.txt" in the foo
folder. This can be done infinitly, so you can organize your pages as you want.

h2. The root folders

The root of your install has various folders
* application/
Contains the business logic of the CMS.
* config/
Surprise! The folder for the config files
* images/
Put the images used for your pages in here
* layouts/
Contains one or more layouts used by all pages. Layouts are rendered around the 
page content and are used to render content used on all pages such as Navigation,
links to stylesheets and so on.
* library/
Your Classes live here.
* pages/
The folder for all pages. Subdirectories can be created to achieve a hierarchical
organization of the pages.
* styles/
A place to put your stylesheets in.

h1. Advanced Usage

The common Layout for all pages is stored in the layouts folder and is named "default.phtml"
by default. This can be changed with the config directive "pages.layout_name".
The path where the layout files are located can be changed with "pages.layout_path".
Both config directives are found in the "pages.ini" config file in the "config" folder.

The layout file uses Zend_View as template engine. To get the content of the requested page, 
simply output $this->content. Just write your HTML as you normally do, or use 
the Helpers provided by Zend_View.
For additional information refer to the manual of Zend_View.
