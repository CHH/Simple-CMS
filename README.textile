h1. Requirements

# > PHP 5.3
# Apache 2.2 with mod_rewrite enabled and access to VHOSTs configuration (not tested without, but could also work)

(For Experts: It can also work on other web servers than Apache, although I haven't tested it. Make sure the rewrite rules are configured correctly, look at the rules in public/.htaccess for reference)

h2. Sample Apache VHOST Configuration

<pre><code>
NameVirtualHost *:80

<VirtualHost *:80>
    DocumentRoot /path/to/dir/where/you/extracted/SimpleCMS

    # Make sure you have registered this with a DNS server
    # or have an entry in your computer's host file (C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts or /etc/hosts on *NIX)
    ServerName your_domain.com

    <Directory "/path/to/dir/where/you/extracted/SimpleCMS">
        Options FollowSymLinks ExecCGI Includes
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
</code></pre>

h1. How to install

h2. Stable Package

# Get a stable package (simple_cms_vX.X.X) from the @Downloads@ section of Github, these are well tested
# Unzip the contents of the downloaded Package, to a folder in the document root of your web server, for example @/var/www/simple_cms@
# Setup a new VHOST and point its document root to the directory of the Simple CMS install, for example @/var/www/simple_cms@. Don't forget to update your @/etc/hosts@ or @C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts@ file with the server name of your VHOST!
# Start your server and open the URL of your VHOST in a Browser -- you should see the Getting Started Page

h2. Developer Snapshot

Just clone the repository with @git clone git://github.com/CHH/Simple-CMS /your/desired/path@ and initialize all dependencies with @git submodule init@ and @git submodule update@.

h1. Usage

h2. Pages

To create a page, simply put a file with the extension ".txt" into the "pages" folder.
If the Root of the Domain (e.g. http://example.com/) gets requested, the page named
"index.txt" gets rendered. 

If you want subpages in the style of "http://example.com/foo/bar" just create
a folder "foo" in the "pages" directory. Then create the file "bar.txt" in the foo
folder. This can be done infinitly, so you can organize your pages as you want.

Pages are formatted with the Textile simple markup Language. You can mix in normal HTML too.

h2. The root folders

The root of your install has various folders

pre.. |- pages/ The folder for all pages. Subdirectories can be created to achieve a hierarchical organization of the pages.
|- library/ All kind of classes used by the Simple CMS core
|- plugins/ Copy the folders of downloaded plugins in there. Plugins can pretty much do everything, so I don't try to explain it here.
|- images/
|- js/ Javascript files for your site
|- styles/ A place to put your stylesheets in.
|- layouts/ Contains one or more layouts used by all pages. Layouts are rendered around the page content and are used to render content used on all pages such as Navigation or links to stylesheets.
