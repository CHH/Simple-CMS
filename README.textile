h1. How to install

# Clone the git repository to your web root (e.g. htdocs folder) with git clone git://github.com/yuri41/Simple-CMS.git
# Clone the Spark Web Framework with git clone git://github.com/yuri41/Spark-Web-Framework in the same folder as you cloned the CMS code
# Make sure you have the Zend Framework either installed over PEAR or somewhere in your PHP include path
# Setup a new Apache virtual host and point the document root to the folder your CMS instance lives in (e.g. htdocs/Simple-CMS). Don't forget to update your /etc/hosts or C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file if you don't own a domain.

h1. Usage

Every public page goes into the pages folder and has the extension ".txt". Every page gets through the Textile parser so you can use HTML and the Textile Markup Language.
The common Layout for all pages is stored in the layouts folder. This file uses Zend_View as template engine. To get the content of the requested page, simply output $this->content. For additional information visit the manual of Zend_View.
